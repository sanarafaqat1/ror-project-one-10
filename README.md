Actors Wikipedia

This application is a Wikipedia page for Actors, where someone can see what awards and what academy their favourite actors had attended.
To access this Wikipedia page all a user needs to do is create and account, which is then saved, so whenever you come back you can then log back into the account. The Sign-up and login pages both have validation, so a user can not create a fake account. Once the user enters the site they will come through to an Actors page which will list out all the actors on our databases. Once you click on show, besides the actor of the users choice appears they will see what academy the actor attended and what awards they have won.
On the Actors page you will also be able to add an Actor of your choice, however the user will have needed to create an academy beforehand. To do so they can redirect to the academy page through the Actors page.

The Struggles I faced at the start of the application was to how I should plan the application to look. This meant I had to plan before starting the application and connecting all the pages needed with logic. During the process of coding the application I struggled using the Docker application as it was not functioning. Getting to fix that took a lot of time which was frustrating, however It was then fixed. To the end of me coding the application I struggled on how to attach the awards to actors page, so that when the users chose the actor, they can see what awards they won. I however overcame all the struggles to now push my application live through Heroku.

For my Sprint 2, I would add more data and create more resources to connect to the actors. I would also want to add the actors onto the academy and awards pages, so when the users click on a certain academy they can see the actors' alumni. I would also work more of the Css to add images to the separate pages.
